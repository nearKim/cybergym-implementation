## 1. Summary
**Current Status:** ðŸŸ¢ On Track / ðŸŸ¡ Minor Obstacles / ðŸ”´ Blocked  

ðŸŸ¢ *Documentation is on the track. We understood the internal logics better.*

ðŸŸ¡ *Confused about how the PoCs are executed and verified.*

ðŸ”´ *Hard to reproduce Enigma due to the SWEBench Setup Issues.*

---

## 2. Key Accomplishments This Week
- Deployed a useful online document 
- Implementation/Installation documentation
- Began experimentation on Cybench

---

## 3. Individual Updates

### [Caroline Cahill]  
**Progress**  
- Completed theory and methods documentation
- Understanding CyberGym's codebase
- Gained access to lab's servers
- Installed CyberGym repository in Kubrick server

**Plans for Next Week**
- Finalize CyberGym setup in Kubrick server
- Successfully reproduce ENiGMA results

**Blockers / Needs**  
- Docker build command is not runnning
    - Error: disk quota exceeded

---


### [In Keun Kim]
**Progress**  
- Completed CyberGym Architecture and API documentation.
- Identified the bugs in CyberGym local setup procedure. (env specific)
- Created helper scripts for CyberGym local setup.
- Started setup on Cybench in Hitchcock server.

**Plans for Next Week**  
- Confirm the Cybench setup on Hitchcock server, and reproduce Cybench experiments.
- Continue to other agents.
- Analyze each agent's code structure in CyberGym-example repository.

**Blockers / Needs**  
- Docker build command on Hitchcock fails - identical issue with Caroline.

### [Song Li]  
**Progress**  
- Wrote the documentation for installation and quick start.
- Finished the Cybench experiment reproduction.

**Plans for Next Week**  
- Enigma experiment reproduction. 

**Blockers / Needs**  
- Hard to reproduce Enigma due to the SWEBench Setup Issues. Need to discuss with SWEBench group in the lab.
