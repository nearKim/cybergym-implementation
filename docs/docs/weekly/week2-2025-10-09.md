## 1. Summary
**Current Status:** ðŸŸ¢ On Track / ðŸŸ¡ Minor Obstacles / ðŸ”´ Blocked  

ðŸŸ¢ *We successfully created and deployed an online document for the future projects.*

ðŸŸ¡ *The CyberGym setup code has minor bugs, the db query fails due to uncreated logs, and needs to implement logging.*

ðŸ”´ *GPU server.*

## 2. Key Accomplishments This Week
- Deployed a useful online document 
- Implementation/Installation documentation
- Began experimentation on Cybench

---

## 3. Individual Updates

### [Caroline Cahill]  
**Progress**  
- Completed CyberGym theory
- Gained access to lab's servers, installed CyberGym repository in Kubrick server

**Plans for Next Week**
- Complete all CyberGym description pages
- Download and run CyberGym after gaining access to the lab's servers

**Blockers / Needs**  
- Docker build command is not runnning
    - Error: disk quota exceeded

### [Song Li]  
**Progress**  
- Debugging the CyberGym setup scripts and trying to run it on local machines  

**Plans for Next Week**  
- Finish benchmarking the performance of different LLMs either on the Colab or university servers. 

**Blockers / Needs**  
- Waiting for the access to the university GPU servers to run the benchmarks. Colab is not really compatible with Docker.
