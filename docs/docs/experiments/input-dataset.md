# Input Dataset: OSS-Fuzz

Quality of PoC generation is an acceptable and important metric to use to evaluate the cybersecurity capabilities of AI agents on challenging real-world problems.

[OSS-Fuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/) is a comprehensive open source dataset, containing details of security vulnerability, including how they were triggered, and how they were patched. Google provides a good tutorial on Fuzzing and how to use [libFuzz](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md).
